# hello-world
 This is my first repository

Hi there!  
I can not code, there is so many problems confuse me, but I realy want to be a coder.  
Peace!  

After three years, I am back!  
It's very hard for me, a Urban Planning student, to learn coding.  
Things have changed a lot, but I am still into internet and computer.  
I hope to get some coding skills to surpport my research.
